    "In this competition, we aim is to build AI models that can solve tough math problems, in other words, creating LLM models capable of solving Math Olympiad problems. This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **Gemma** LLM model with LoRA to solve math problems using KerasNLP. With KerasNLP, fine-tuning with LoRA becomes straightforward with just a few lines of code.\n",

    "**Did you know:**: This notebook is backend-agnostic? Which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n",

    "\n",
    "An important part of the Gemma model is the **Preprocessor** layer, which under the hood uses **Tokenizer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** The preprocessor takes input strings and transforms them into a dictionary (`token_ids`, `padding_mask`) containing preprocessed tensors. This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n",

    "# Fine-tuning with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "To get better responses from the model, we will fine-tune the model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What exactly is LoRA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA is a method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) in an efficient way. It involves freezing the weights of the LLM and injecting trainable rank-decomposition matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine in an LLM, we have a pre-trained dense layer, represented by a $d \\times d$ weight matrix, denoted as $W_0$. We then initialize two additional dense layers, labeled as $A$ and $B$, with shapes $d \\times r$ and $r \\times d$, respectively. Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\n",
    "Credit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store. So, even though the overall model might seem bigger, it's actually more efficient in terms of memory usage. \n",
